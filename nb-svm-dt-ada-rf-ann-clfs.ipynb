Choice of Model \n","\n","Out of all the models, Logistic Regression model performs the best. The Precision, Recall, f1-score, accuracy, ROC AUC are all good. \n","In case of Naive Bayes, the recall is low.\n","In case of ANN, the none of the metrics are low, but since Logistic Regression also gives similar scores, it is better to choose Logistic Regression model since it takes lesser time to train and is easier to interpret and implement. \n","The precision and recall is very low in case of Random Forest Classifier so it is not a good choice. \n","In case of Decision Tree Classifier, the ROC AUC, precision, recall are low and this model cannot be used.
